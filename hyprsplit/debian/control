Description: awesome / dwm like workspaces for hyprland
 A complete rewrite of split-monitor-workspaces that attempts to fix the issues
 I experienced with it. Improvements include:
 - Workspaces on each monitor are determined by that monitor's ID
 - Ability to grab windows that get lost in invalid workspaces when
   disconnecting monitors
 - Dispatcher to swap all windows in active workspaces between two monitors
 - Better handling of workspace params. For example empty will work properly
   and select an empty workspace on the current monitor.
 .
 Packaged for hyprland-unstable.
