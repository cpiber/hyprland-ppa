hyprscroller for Ubuntu
------------------

This package contains a build of the plugin repository `hyprscroller`, matched to hyprland-unstable.
To use it, run `hyprpm add hyprscroller` once to set it up (analogous to `hyprpm add https://github.com/cpiber/hyprscroller`).
Then, enable one of the plugins contained.

Note that on every plugin update, you need to run `hyprpm update` to activate the update.
Plugins are also updated on every Hyprland update, since plugins are built for a particular version of Hyprland.
