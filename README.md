# hyprland-ppa

This repository contains the `debian/` files for my PPA.
These files detail the recipe for building a .deb package.
Currently these work for Ubuntu 24.04 Noble, 25.04 Plucky 25.10 Questing.

Ubuntu 22.04 Jammy is also supported, but in limited capacity, has the system is quite outdated.
Some packages may have reduced functionality or only older versions of the package.
Jammy-specific patches are applied by `jammy.sh` in the respective package folder.

Published packages are available here: https://launchpad.net/~cppiber/+archive/ubuntu/hyprland

## Packages

Packages are organized into subfolders.
Each package contains two folders: `debian/` and `source/`.
The source code of the packages is not stored here and instead embedded as a git submodule.
Hence, the debian subdirectory instead does not live in the source code.
This repository contains some scripts to deal with this.

To initialize all packages:

```console
$ git clone https://github.com/cpiber/hyprland-ppa.git  # Clone this repository
$ git submodule update --init --recursive  # Fetch all package sources
```

## Scripts

### Updating a package

```console
$ ./scripts/update.sh <package>
```

This script will fetch the latest changes for the specified package.
All packages except `hyprland` and `waybar-unstable` will check out the lastest tag.
The two mentioned exceptions will check out the lastest commit on main/master.

The script additionally generates the appropriate changelog from the commit names.
If the version did not change, the script exists with code 1 and does not apply any changes.

### Building a package

```console
$ ./scripts/open-build.sh <package> [<distribution>]
```

This script prepares a build area in `/tmp/hyprland-ppa/` and opens a shell there for building.
It copies both the `source/` and `debian/` folders together into the expected structure.
Some packages additionally contain a `prepare.sh` file, which is executed in the resulting build environment.
This may be used to exclude files from the final archive.

As the last step, the script generates the `<package>_<version>.orig.tar.xz` file necessary for building the package.
The actual build is left to the user.

The optional `<distribution>` argument may be used to build a separate version for a different distribution than specified in the `debian/` folder.
This option generates a new entry in the changelog and appends `~1<distribution>1` to the version field, allowing a rebuild with no changes for this distribution.
Make sure to use the same orig file, as launchpad refuses to accept one with a different checksum.

Information about my build setup: https://github.com/cpiber/ppa/blob/main/build.md

### No-change rebuild

```console
$ ./scripts/rebuild.sh <package>
$ ./scripts/rebuild-depends.sh <packages...>
```

The first script simply increments the patch part of the version number (new changelog entry).
This allows a rebuild of the package when no source changes were found, as necessary when a dependency changes (with ABI changes) or a new patch is introduced.

The second script instead takes a package name (or multiple) and asks `apt-cache` for dependents.
It then calls the former script to rebuild all reverse dependencies.
Use this when a breaking change is introduced and a new build needs to be kicked off for depending packages.

See [Building a package](#building-a-package) for actually starting the build.

### Working with patches

The unconventional location of the `debian/` folder means existing tooling will not automatically pick it up.
When working with `quilt`, I recommend the following setting:

```console
$ export QUILT_PATCHES=../debian/patches
```

With this, `quilt` will pick up the patches and patches can be applied as usual, see [the manual](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/maint-guide/modify.en.html).
